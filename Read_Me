Unity - Mouse Following Line

This Script and Shader were used to produce a line made up of spheres. The first sphere moves towards the mouse,
and each successive sphere follows the previous sphere. The shader colours the sphere based on its current xy position
in the screen.
Sphere speed is based on a float multiplied by the spheres distance to it's target. This prevents spheres from becoming totally overlapped
and remaining that way.

Code is based on code from Building a Graph Tutorial by Jasper Flick https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/building-a-graph/
